Model View Controller (MVC)

  Separates out the application into three different parts:
    (allows for easier debugging and re-use of code)

    MODEL = the data and how its stored (i.e. databases)
    VIEW = the output of the application (i.e. templates)
    CONTROLLER = takes requests from the VIEW, handles requests appropriately
                 and decides what to do with the input as it sends it to the MODEL
