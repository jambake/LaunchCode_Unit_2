"In Python, everything is an OBJECT"

Classify OBJECTS: Classes or Data Types

'type' function

'integers' (no decimal - whole number)
floating point (class = 'float')

'strings' are surrounded by single/double/triple quotes
  double - quoting something (even ints and floats)
  triple - message that uses multiple lines

NO COMMAS in long numbers

Changing TYPES (type conversion) 3 IMPORTANT DATA TYPES:
  int()
  float()
  str()

type() ~ function provides data type of object

value/object interchangeable
class/type = interchangeable

single/double/triple quoting numbers makes them a str

double quotes inside single/triple quotes PRINT the double quotes

COMMAS treat ints/floats as separate values
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NAMES for objects or values are called 'variables'

NAMES are like sticky notes

Assignment Statement - 'name = value'
 '=' - Assignment Operator
 '==' - equal

namespace        |        objectspace

Legal Names - begin with a letter or '_' (can contain numbers, but cannot use Python reserved names i.e. 'if')

Variable names can NEVER contain 'spaces'

Python KEYWORDS:
and 	as 	assert 	break 	class 	continue
def 	del 	elif 	else 	except 	exec
finally 	for 	from 	global 	if 	import
in 	is 	lambda 	nonlocal 	not 	or
pass 	raise 	return 	try 	while 	with
yield 	True 	False 	None
(CANNOT be used s VARIABLES)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

len('________') = length of a string

EXPRESSIONS (+, *, /, -, etc...) can be used on the righthand side of an ASSIGNMENT statement

EXPRESSIONS are composed of both OPERATORS and OPERANDS
*Operators are special tokens that represent computations like addition, multiplication and division.
The values the operator works on are called operands.*

EXPONENT = **
// = integer division (no decimal)
% = remainder of devision ('modulus')

An expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and calls to functions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'input' function - prompts user for a value that will be assigned to provided object 'n'
n = input("Where do you live?")
*All output types from the 'input' function are type 'str'*
Use a type function to convert the result to desired type
